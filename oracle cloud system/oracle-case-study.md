## Introduction

Oracle cloud is a cloud computing service offered by Oracle corporation, one of the world's largest software company. The company sells the oracle Database software and cloud computing. It's core software application is build to help enterprices in their software products such as the enterprice resource planning (ERP), the human capital management (HCM), customer relationship management (CRM).
Oracle is higly known for it cloud services including infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), software as a service (SaaS) and data as a service (DaaS).

## Brief History

- 2008-2001: Initial Launch:Oracle cloud computing came in light in 2008 with primary focus on providing cloud-based version for oracle's software products such databases and applications.
- 2012-2015: Within the next few years of 2012 to 2015, oracle expanded its cloud services to include offering of services such as infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and the plateform as a service (PaaS) which allowed customers to migrate their existing oracle workloads to the cloud and be able to deploy new applications and services.
- 2016: Oracle rebranded its cloud offerings to "Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)". This came in with new investment in building next-generation cloud platform which included services such as compute, storage, networking, databases and developer tools permitting the company to compete with other cloud providers.
- 2017: Autonomous services. Oracle launch the autonomous service within it cloud platform which permitted databases to have autonomous services such automatic updates.
